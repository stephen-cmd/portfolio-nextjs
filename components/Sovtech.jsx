                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
                   I am very passionate about technology and business and being able to merge those two and work for an organization that have the same core values, excites me.
                   
                   
                </p>
                
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
                   I have always thoroughly enjoyed finding ways to solve problems and create new ideas and at SovTech clients come to solve a problem and/or bring life to an idea.
                </p>
                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
                   Engineering creative solutions which grow our clientsâ€™ and our own business in an environment which encourages achievement, but values authenticity and a team spirit means I can leverage 
                   and hone my skills and learn from not only my colleagues,but from our clients as well.
